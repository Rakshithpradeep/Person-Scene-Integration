# Person-Scene Integration

This project integrates person detection with scene recognition to analyze and interpret images where human subjects are present within various environments. The objective is to identify people in an image and understand the surrounding scene for tasks such as surveillance, context-aware computing, and smart image tagging.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Detects human presence using pre-trained YOLOv8.
- Performs scene classification on the image background.
- Combines both detections to give a contextual understanding.
- Outputs annotated image with both bounding boxes and scene labels.
